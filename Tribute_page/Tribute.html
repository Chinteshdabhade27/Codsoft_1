                    a young age. He pursued higher education at the University of Calcutta, earning a Bachelor of Arts

                    Ramakrishna's passing, Vivekananda traveled extensively across India as a wandering monk, gaining
                    deep insights into the country's socio-economic conditions.</p>

                    World's Religions in Chicago in 1893. His opening words, "Sisters and brothers of America," received
                    a standing ovation, and his eloquent speeches introduced Vedanta and Yoga to the Western audience.
